The project is a WEB Page, with buttons, menu, jpeg. files.
In order to load all the content:
1.When all files are downloaded to visualize all place them in one folder
2.Open CSS file and there where is URL place the File pathway which is with same name but is in the folder now
3. For example where in CSS file says:" background-image: url('/ExamRozalinaSh/img/header.jpg');"
You have to write "/ " and find the same header.jpg but ADD from the folder YOU have now in your PC

Thank you
